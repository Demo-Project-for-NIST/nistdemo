# AI System Risk Assessment - Complete Guide

## üéØ **What is AI System Risk Assessment?**

AI System Risk Assessment is the process of **evaluating cybersecurity risks** in artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, specifically focused on **supply chain operations**. Your toolkit automates this process using **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0** standards.

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Federal Mandate**: Executive Order 14028 requires federal agencies to assess AI risks
- **Supply Chain Vulnerability**: AI systems can be compromised, affecting entire supply chains
- **Compliance Requirement**: Organizations need NIST CSF 2.0 compliance for AI systems
- **Financial Impact**: AI failures can cost millions in supply chain disruptions

## üìã **AI System Risk Assessment Form - Field by Field**

### 1. **System Name**
**What it is:** Identifier for the AI system you're assessing
**Examples:**
- "Credit Risk Assessment Model v2.1"
- "Supplier Fraud Detection System" 
- "Demand Forecasting Engine"
- "Invoice Processing AI"

**Why it matters:** Each AI system has different risk profiles. A credit scoring system has different risks than a chatbot.

### 2. **Model Type** - CRITICAL RISK FACTOR
**What it is:** The machine learning algorithm/architecture used

**Options & Risk Levels:**

| Model Type | Risk Level | Why |
|------------|------------|-----|
| **Linear Regression** | LOW | Simple, explainable, predictable behavior |
| **Random Forest** | MEDIUM | Ensemble method, moderately explainable |
| **Gradient Boosting** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Complex interactions, harder to debug |
| **Neural Network** | HIGH | Black box, vulnerable to adversarial attacks |
| **Deep Neural Network** | VERY HIGH | Completely opaque, maximum attack surface |

**Real Example:**
- **Random Forest** for credit scoring: Can explain which factors influenced decision
- **Deep Neural Network** for image recognition: Cannot explain why it made decision

### 3. **Deployment Environment** - INFRASTRUCTURE RISK
**What it is:** Where your AI system runs

**Options & Risk Implications:**

| Environment | Risk Factors | Supply Chain Impact |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **AWS SageMaker** | Cloud security, vendor dependency | AWS outage = AI system down |
| **Azure ML** | Microsoft security, data sovereignty | Different compliance requirements |
| **Google Cloud** | Google security policies | Varied regional availability |
| **On-Premise** | Your responsibility for security | Full control but full liability |

**Real Scenario:** If your supplier risk scoring AI runs on AWS and AWS has an outage, you can't assess supplier safety, potentially leading to supply chain disruptions.

### 4. **Data Sources** - INPUT RISK ASSESSMENT
**What it is:** Where your AI gets its data from

**Examples & Risks:**

| Data Source | Risk Level | Why Risky |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **internal_db** | MEDIUM | Could be compromised internally |
| **credit_bureau** | HIGH | External dependency, data quality issues |
| **market_data** | MEDIUM | Manipulation possible, timeliness issues |
| **social_media** | VERY HIGH | Easily manipulated, unreliable |
| **iot_sensors** | HIGH | Physical tampering possible |

**Real Attack:** Attackers poison your training data by submitting fake supplier information, causing your AI to approve risky suppliers.

### 5. **Third-Party Libraries** - SUPPLY CHAIN RISK
**What it is:** External code libraries your AI system depends on

**Common Libraries & Risk Levels:**

| Library | Risk Level | Why |
|---------|------------|-----|
| **scikit-learn** | MEDIUM | Widely used, well-maintained, but large attack surface |
| **tensorflow** | HIGH | Complex, frequent updates, Google dependency |
| **pytorch** | HIGH | Research-focused, rapid changes, Facebook dependency |
| **pandas** | MEDIUM | Data processing, potential for data corruption |
| **numpy** | LOW-MEDIUM | Mathematical operations, stable but foundational |

**Real Scenario:** A malicious update to TensorFlow could compromise all AI models using it globally.

## üéØ **How Risk Scoring Works**

### **Risk Calculation Formula:**
```
Base Risk Score = 
  + Data Lineage Issues (20 points)
  + Model Explainability Issues (15 points) 
  + Missing Drift Monitoring (25 points)
  + Third-Party Library Risks (20 points)
  + Data Security Issues (15 points)
  √ó Economic Stress Multiplier (1.0-2.0)
```

### **Example Calculation:**
**High-Risk System:**
- Deep Neural Network (black box) = +15 points
- No data lineage documentation = +20 points  
- No drift monitoring = +25 points
- Uses TensorFlow + PyTorch = +15 points
- No encryption = +10 points
- High economic stress = √ó1.5 multiplier
- **Total: (15+20+25+15+10) √ó 1.5 = 85/100 (Critical Risk)**

## üîç **CSF Risk Mapping Explorer - Explained**

### **What is CSF Mapping?**
CSF (Cybersecurity Framework) Mapping connects **specific AI risks** to **official NIST cybersecurity categories**. This shows auditors and compliance officers exactly which security controls you need.

### **The 8 AI Risk Types:**

#### 1. **Training Data Poisoning**
- **What it is:** Attackers corrupt your AI's training data
- **Example:** Adding fake "good" suppliers to training data so AI approves bad suppliers
- **Maps to CSF:** ID.RA-01 (identify vulnerabilities), PR.DS-06 (data integrity)

#### 2. **Model Drift** 
- **What it is:** AI performance degrades over time without warning
- **Example:** Credit risk model becomes inaccurate as economic conditions change
- **Maps to CSF:** DE.CM-07 (continuous monitoring), GV.OC-04 (governance oversight)

#### 3. **Adversarial Examples**
- **What it is:** Crafted inputs designed to fool the AI
- **Example:** Slightly modified invoice that bypasses fraud detection
- **Maps to CSF:** PR.AC-07 (access controls), DE.AE-02 (anomaly detection)

#### 4. **Model Inversion**
- **What it is:** Attackers extract sensitive data from your AI model
- **Example:** Reverse-engineering customer data from a recommendation system
- **Maps to CSF:** PR.DS-01 (data protection), ID.SC-05 (supplier assessment)

#### 5. **Supply Chain ML Attack**
- **What it is:** Malicious code in your AI's dependencies
- **Example:** Trojan in a machine learning library steals model weights
- **Maps to CSF:** ID.SC-03 (supplier cybersecurity), PR.DS-08 (integrity checking)

#### 6. **Data Lineage Gaps**
- **What it is:** You can't trace where your data came from
- **Example:** Can't identify which supplier data is corrupted when model fails
- **Maps to CSF:** ID.AM-03 (data flow documentation), GV.SC-01 (supply chain strategy)

#### 7. **Model Backdoors**
- **What it is:** Hidden triggers in AI models
- **Example:** Model works normally except when specific input pattern appears
- **Maps to CSF:** ID.RA-09 (hardware/software integrity), PR.DS-06 (integrity checking)

#### 8. **AI System Dependency**
- **What it is:** Over-reliance on AI without human oversight
- **Example:** Fully automated supplier approval without human review
- **Maps to CSF:** GV.OC-02 (governance transparency), RC.RP-04 (recovery planning)
