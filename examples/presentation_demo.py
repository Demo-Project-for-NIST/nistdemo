TARGET EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This research prototype explores AI risk assessment by providing automated AI risk 
assessment aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0. It's the first 
open-source research prototype combining AI security + supply chain risk + standards alignment.

TIP VALUE PROPOSITION:
• Saves $50K-500K vs proprietary solutions
• Prevents AI-related supply chain failures
• Generates audit-ready compliance reports
• Ready for immediate federal agency deployment
